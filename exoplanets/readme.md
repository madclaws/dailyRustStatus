# Habitable Exoplanets

An exoplanet is a planet orbiting a star other than our sun and we can actually detect these planets now! It turns out there are a lot of exoplanets and everyone is wondering whether anything lives there. How far the exoplanet is from its host star can determine whether it can support life or not. If it's too close to the star the planet would be too hot for life to survive there. Too far and now it's too cold to support life. There is a sweet spot in between called the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) in which a planet's surface is just the right temperature to support liquid water: not too hot and not too cold.
