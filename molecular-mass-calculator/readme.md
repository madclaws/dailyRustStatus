# Molecular Mass Calculator

Molecules are made up of atoms, so to calculate the mass of a molecule you just add up the masses of the atoms but each atom has a different mass.Atoms are so light that using grams to describe their mass is pretty annoying so we use other units like the atomic mass unit (amu). 1 amu is defined as one twelevth the mass of a carbon-12 atom, or `1.661 x 10^-27`. For example, water (H2O) is a molecule made up of two hydrogens and an oxygen. The hydrogen (H) atoms have a mass of 1.008 amu while carbon (C) has a mass of 12.011 amu and the heaviest atom on the periodic table, Oganesson (Og), has a mass of 294 amu while a methane molecule (CH4) has a mass of 16.04 amu.

Given the chemical formula of a molecule, return its mass in amu. You might find `periodic_table.csv` useful. It's a comma-separated file containing all the elements from the periodic table and their masses in amu.
